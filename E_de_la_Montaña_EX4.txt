EX4 - Random Access Files Instructions

You have an object of the RandomAccessFile class named empRaf. It refers to a physical file that contains a company's employee records. Each employee record has:

   an int field named empID which points to its location in the file

   a 20 character last name

   a 15 character first_name

   a hire date stored as an int

   a 3 character job code


The empID values begin at 1, but the first record in the file begins at byte 0.

1. Calculate the length of this record.
  Long recordLength = 
    (Integer.SIZE / 8) + (lName.length() * 2) + (fName.length() * 2) + (Integer.SIZE / 8) + (jCode.length() *2);
    // (32 / 8) + (20 * 2) + (15 * 2) + (32 / 8) + (3 * 2) = 84

2. Write a statement that positions the file pointer at the beginning of the record that has empID 20. 
  empRaf.seek(recordLength * (20 - 1));
